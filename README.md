# Document similarity in job descriptions

In looking for the next step in my career, there are many titles used; Tableau Product Manager, Tableau Program Manager, Tableau Administrator, BI Manager, and the list goes on. Through selectively sampling titles I believe are synonymous with Tableau Program Manager, I have compiled a model to gauge and cluster the similarity of job duties to find the average job description.

## Getting Started

This model can be fed any data in list format. Select your .csv file to import, and simply run the cells.
